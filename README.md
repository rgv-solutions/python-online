=============

Simple python interpreter written in JavaScript using Jison as a parser generator and lexer.
Bastardized, poorly written, barely functional with all the useful features of the language stripped out. Purely an academic exercise.

### About
Parser and lexer generated with [Jison](http://zaach.github.io/jison/), uses [jq-console](https://github.com/replit/jq-console) and the [Ace](http://ace.c9.io/#nav=about) editor for the demo. Many thanks to [Dr. Brian Malloy](http://people.cs.clemson.edu/~malloy/) for his lessons in grammars and life.

### Demo
[Check it out online.](https://rgv-solutions.github.io/python-online/)

#### Todo
* Support expressions as parameters
* len() operation on strings
